# Project Title (This is a template README.md file that you can adapt to your project)

> A project to compare rainfall patterns between Seattle, St. Louis, and another city (e.g. New York) from 2018 to 2022.

---

## Project Overview

This project analyzes historical precipitation data to determine how rainfall in Seattle compares with other U.S. cities.  
Using NOAA’s Climate Data Online and provided datasets, we will perform exploratory data analysis and visualizations.

- **Objective:** Compare rainfall across multiple cities from 2018–2022.
- **Domain:** Climate / Environmental Data Science
- **Key Techniques:** Time Series Analysis, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Data

- **Seattle rainfall data**: [seattle_rain.csv](https://github.com/brian-fischer/DATA-5100/blob/main/weather/seattle_rain.csv)
- **St. Louis rainfall data**: [stl_rain.csv](https://github.com/brian-fischer/DATA-5100/blob/main/weather/stl_rain.csv)
- **Comparison city rainfall data**: Downloaded from [NOAA Climate Data Online](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/)

## Analysis

Describe the notebooks and/or scripts used to perform the analysis. Specify the order in which the code should be run to reproduce the results.

---

## Results

Final results will summarize patterns in rainfall and assess whether Seattle experiences more rain than the comparison city.
